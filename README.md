# MetAMOS web interface
Web interface for running MetAMOS (https://github.com/marbl/metAMOS) workflows.
A user can choose a preconfigured workflow and a sample on which it should be
run. Administrator can change the list of available workflows.


## Requirements
This project requires Python 2.7.3, Django 1.4.5, jQuery 1.11 and
Bootstrap 3.1.1. It also needs an SQL database and a web server. It was tested
with SQLite and Apache, but any database and server compatible with Django
should work.
